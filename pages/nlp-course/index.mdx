# NLP Course <Hl color="green">| For You</Hl>

<Cl comic>
  This is an extension to the (ML for)
  [Natural Language Processing course](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/nlp_course)
  I teach at the [Yandex School of Data Analysis (YSDA)](https://yandexdataschool.com) since fall 2018.
  For now, only part of the topics is likely to be covered here.

    ### This new format of the course is designed for:
    - convenience
      <Cl comic>
        Easy to find, learn or recap  material (both standard and more advanced), and to
        try in practice.
      </Cl>
    - clarity
      <Cl comic>
        Each part, from front to back, is a result of my care
        not only about what to say, but also
        how to say and, especially, how to show something.
      </Cl>
    - you
      <Cl comic>
        I wanted to make these materials so that you (yes, you!)
        could study on your own, what you like, and at your pace.
        My main purpose is to help you enter your own very personal adventure.

      ## Lectures-blogs
      <Cl comic>which I tried to make:</Cl>

      ## Research Thinking
      <Cl comic>Learn to think as a research scientist:</Cl>
      - <Cl comic>find flaws in an approach,</Cl>
      - <Cl comic>think why/when something can help,</Cl>
      - <Cl comic>come up with ways to improve,</Cl>
      - <Cl comic>learn about previous attempts.</Cl>
      <Cl comic>
        It's well-known that you will learn something easier
        if you are not just given the answer right away, but if you think about it first. Even
        if you don't want to be a researcher, this is still a good way to learn things!
