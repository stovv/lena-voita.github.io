      In NMT, each prediction is based on two types of context: the source and the prefix of the target sentence.
      We show how to evaluate the relative contributions of source and target to NMT predictions and find that:
      - models suffering from exposure bias are more prone to over-relying on target history (and hence to hallucinating) than
      the ones where the exposure bias is mitigated;
      - models trained with more data rely on the source more and do it more confidently;
      - the training process is non-monotonic with several distinct stages.
